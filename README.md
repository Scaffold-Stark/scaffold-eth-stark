# Scaffold-ETH-Stark

<h4 align="center">
  <a href="https://docs.scaffoldstark.com/eth-stark/">Documentation</a>
</h4>

🧪 An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on Starknet and EVM blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

⚙️ Built using NextJS, Starknet.js, Scarb, Starknet-React, Starknet Foundry, RainbowKit, Foundry, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

- 🪝 **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldstark.com/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) and [starknet-react](https://starknet-react.com/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- 🔐 **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with Starknet network and EVM network.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.18)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)
- [Cairo 1.0 extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1)
- [Foundryup](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

> **Note for Windows users**. Foundryup is not currently supported by Powershell or Cmd. You will need to use [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as your terminal.

### Starknet-devnet version

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your local `starknet-devnet` version must be `0.2.0`. To accomplish this, first check your local starknet-devnet version:

```sh
starknet-devnet --version
```

If your local starknet-devnet version is not `0.2.0`, you need to install it.

- Install Starknet-devnet `0.2.0` via `asdf` ([instructions](https://github.com/gianalarcon/asdf-starknet-devnet/blob/main/README.md)).

### Scarb version

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your local `Scarb` version must be `2.8.3`. To accomplish this, first check your local Scarb version:

```sh
scarb --version
```

If your local Scarb version is not `2.8.3`, you need to install it.

- Install Scarb `2.8.3` via `asdf` ([instructions](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf)).

### Starknet Foundry version

To ensure the proper functioning of the tests on scaffold-stark, your Starknet Foundry version must be 0.31.0. To accomplish this, first check your Starknet Foundry version:

```sh
snforge --version
```

If your Starknet Foundry version is not `0.31.0`, you need to install it.

- Install Starknet Foundry `0.31.0` via `asdf` ([instructions](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html#installation-via-asdf)).

## Compatible versions

- Starknet-devnet - v0.2.0
- Scarb - v2.8.3
- Snforge - v0.31.0
- Cairo - v2.8.2
- Rpc - v0.7.1

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Scaffold-Stark/scaffold-eth-stark
cd scaffold-eth-stark
yarn install
```

2. Run a local eth network in the first terminal:

```bash
yarn chain:eth
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Anvil for testing and development. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `config.ts`.

3. Run a local starknet network in the second terminal:

```bash
yarn chain:strk
```

This command starts a local Starknet network using Devnet. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `config.ts` for your nextjs app.

4. Copy .env.example to .env and set the correct variables

```bash
cp ./packages/foundry/.env.example ./packages/foundry/.env
cp ./packages/snfoundry/.env.example ./packages/snfoundry/.env
```

5. On a third terminal, deploy your smart contract(s) on the eth network and starknet network:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a sample smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src` and `packages/foundry/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in`packages/snfoundry/scripts-ts/deploy.ts` and `packages/foundry/script/Deploy.s.sol` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

By default, `Scaffold-Stark` uses the first prefunded account from `starknet-devnet` as the deployer address for Starknet contracts. For Ethereum contracts, when deploying to the local chain, `Scaffold-ETH 2` creates a keystore account using Anvil's last address private key. This keystore account is named `scaffold-eth-local` with the password `localhost`.

> **Note**: If you want to deploy to a network beside devnet
> For starknet, you need to fill the env file under `./packages/snfoundry/.env` with the correct values.
> For ethereum, you need to fill the env file under `./packages/foundry/.env` with the correct values.
>
> Then for starknet, run `yarn deploy:strk --network ${YOUR_NETWORK}`
> For ethereum, run `yarn deploy:eth --network ${YOUR_NETWORK}`

6. On a fourth terminal, start your NextJS app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/config.ts`.
